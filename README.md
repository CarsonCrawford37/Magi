<h2>Description</h2>
Magi is an upcoming virtual reality game project that I am solo developing as part of my Senior Capstone to complete my studies at Boise State University. The game will offer an immersive VR experience, complete with challenging puzzles and combat, all featuring a distinctive speech-to-text spell-casting system. As players navigate through the game's environment, they will encounter ancient enemies, discover new spells, and try to find their way out of the underground ruins they are trapped in..
